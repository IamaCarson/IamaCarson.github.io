      <h2 class="question">What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p1 class="answer">Carson's Gadgets is made for a few different reasons.<br>
        One reason is to have a hub for all my published projects and works,<br>
        including but not limited to coding projects. Another reason it is made<br>
        is to just be fun and whacky and I can just put anything I want on here.<br>
        To me making website is fun and being able to show my passions and works <br>
        to other people make it worth it.
