Sorry to interrupt but how to make background bouncing?
Not exactly sure what you mean with bouncing (up and down? Pulsing to the beat?) but this is how you do stuff with the background
HOW DO I DO STUFF WITH THE BACKGROUND (on the Mirin template)

First, place the background in the lua folder, then you need to declare the background as an actor before all the proxy declarations (inside layout.xml if you're using version 5.0)
><children>
  <Layer File = "bg.png" Name = "bg" />

  <!-- and then all the PC/PP/PJ declarations -->
</children></Mods>

This is so it shows behind everything else, now if you run it you'll see the background on the top left corner, to fix it do a little bit of setup on the "here go your mods" part:
-- your code goes here here:
bg:xywh(scx, scy, sw, sh) --Place at the center, stretch to the screen size

And now you have a static background with the nice thing that you can modify it mid modfile! For example try out adding func {2, function() bg:rainbow() end}

To make it pulse to the beat, like in Caramelldansen for example, there are several ways to do it, the easiest way is something like this:
--New mod that changes the background zoom
definemod {'bgzoom', function(x) bg:zoom(x) end}
setdefault {'bgzoom', 1}

--Now, every beat, pop its zoom up and down by 20%, causing it to pulse!
for i = 1, 128 do
  ease {i, 0.5, pop, 1.2, 'bgzoom'}
end
